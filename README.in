=====================
django-compat-patcher
=====================

A "magic" package which adds retro/forward compatibility patches to Django, so that your app ecosystem doesn't get broken by trivial changes in the core of the framework.

Add :code:`django-compat-patcher` to your pip requirements, install it, and then activate it with::
    
    import django_compat_patcher
    django_compat_patcher.patch()
    
This code must be placed BEFORE any use of django (eg. in your :code:`manage.py` or your :code:`wsgi.py` script).

However, the :code:`DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable must already be set.
